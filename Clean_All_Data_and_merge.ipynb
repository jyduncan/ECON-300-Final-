    "# Grab Data on Race and Sex\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code usess the Urban Institue's API to get information at the school distirct level for race and sex. Because of the way the API is set up, an API call must be done for every combination of State, Year, and Grade (3,000 links). I originally tried to do all of this in once cell in one loop. However, I kept running into issues where I was hitting the API link too much and getting an error. Furthermore if an error occurs late into the process the entire code must be re-run. Thus I think it is best to break this up into years, and merge the data together at the end. This is what I have done below and was ultimatley succsessful. Do note that this likely will take between 2-3 hours to run all the code. "

    "\n",
    "There is certain data in the data set that has a value of -2. A -2 indicates not applicable to the data. This mostly arrises for issues of tax revenue. For instance if a state does not have a sales tax then -2 would be reflected in that information for all states without a sales tax. It should be ok to replace -2 with 0 values since the lack of that revenue source will not change the toatal revenue. We drop V33 due to issues with data quality, and because we are able to obtain enrollment information from race and sex data. C16- C18 are dropped due to being only in some of the earlier files, and not having a signifcant impact. "
